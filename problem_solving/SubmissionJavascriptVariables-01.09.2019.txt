## Questions

### 1 What type of variable name casing do you use in JavaScript? (think of snakes or camels)

_camelCase_

### 2 If you want to create a variable called mentor and set its value equal to the name of your mentor, how would you do that?

#### `var mentor;`
#### `mentor = 'TJ Stalcup';`

### 3 How would you then log the value of mentor to the console?

`console.log(mentor);`


### 4 Describe the difference between let, var, and const.

_A variable defined with `var` is scoped to the entire function, or the global scope if declared outside of a function. Its value can be reassigned._

_A variable defined with `let` is scoped to a particular code block, or set of curly brackets {}. Its value can be reassigned within that scope._

_A variable defined with `const` is scoped to a particular code block, or set of curly brackets {}. Its value cannot be reassigned within that scope._

# Code Practice
## Using `var`, `let` and `const` create 3 variables that will hold your name, state, and hair color.

```javascript

var name = 'Michael';
let state = 'Washington';
const hairColor = 'Black';
console.log(name);
console.log(state);
console.log(hairColor);
