### I am working on the Code Practice for Functions / Checkpoint 2876 / Section ID 367

###I have spent some time going back over the chapter on functions and reviewing the different terms and definitions of items used in functions. I am note sure if I have the correct code as I don't see any output.  Is my code solution correct for the code practice at the end of this checkpoint or do I need to fix some part of my code. Thanks for the help!

```javascript
// the variable shoppingCart is an array
// since the elements inside of array can change we want to write a function which will always be able to total up the elements inside the array
var shoppingCart = [20, 15];
// we are declaring a function getTotalCost which will total up the elements inside the shopping cart array
function getTotalCost(prices){
//prices is the input we are going to use in this function / `prices` is a local variable
//in this case `prices` input is going to use the shopping cart arrays elements
  let total = 0;
  for (let i=0; i < prices.length; i++) 
    { 
    total = prices[i] + total;
    }     
  // code above
  return total;
  
}
//using the input shoppingCart variable execute the getTotalCost Function
getTotalCost(shoppingCart);

```
