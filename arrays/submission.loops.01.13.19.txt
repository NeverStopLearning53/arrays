### Questions
### What are the three things you need to provide for a loop? I.e., in `for(a ; b ; c){}`, what are a, b, and c?
*- a- _initialization_-where the initial condition of the loop is setup.
*- b-_condition_ where Javascript checks the condition before each iteration of the loop. If the condition evaluates to `true`, the loop will continue to run, if not, the loop will stop.
*- c-_final-expression_this runs after each iteration of the loop. It is the job of the final-expression to change the condition so that the loop eventually stops.
### Describe infinite loops and how to avoid them.
###### Infinite Loop - This occurs when the condition of the loop is always true, so the loop never stops. Infinite loops can freeze or crash your computer. Writing and testing your final-expression making sure the loop stops is extremely important to making sure you don't have an _infinite loop_.
