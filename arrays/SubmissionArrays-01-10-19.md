### **Questions**
#### **1 Describe an array.**

##### _An array is a collection of items/elements where each has  location, or index, associated with it._

#### **2 In JavaScript can you have a single array with a string and a number in it?**

##### _You can store multiple data types in the same array, e.g. [4, 'Alex', null, 'food']. But just because you can doesn't mean you should. It is much easier to work with your data in lists that are of the same type._

##### **3 In JavaScript do arrays start at index 0 or index 1?**
##### _Index 0_
### **Code Practice**

**Using the clothes variable below use the push() method to add a new item to the clothes array. The new item should be called pants.**

```javascript

var clothes = ['collared shirt', 'shirt'];

clothes.push('pants'); //adding 'pants' item to clothes array

console.log(clothes);

```
